The capstone class of the Digital Information Design program combines all four disciplines to create a product for a real business. My group's project was to build a site and ordering system for a local bakery in Rock Hill, SC. As a web application design person, I was responsible for the backend of the site. I created a login flow, set up routing for the menu, made dynamic order forms, and built a cart system. The live site can be found at [www.thewhiskitshoppe.com](https://www.thewhiskitshoppe.com/).
