For a visual communication class, we were challenged with redesigning a site for a video game. I choose Farming Simulator because I felt the existing site did not fully display the beauty of the game. For the design, I featured visuals from the game so that way they were the focus of the site. I also used earthy tones and metallic effects to reference the farm and the equipment which is such a large part of the game.
