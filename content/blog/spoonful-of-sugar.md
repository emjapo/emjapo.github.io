For a visual communication class, we were challenged with designing a site around an object and targeting a demographic that would be interested in the object. I choose spoons and targeted children and parents of young children by making content that would make spoons appealing to them. For the design, I kept everything round and fun to make the site feel childlike, inviting, and playful.
