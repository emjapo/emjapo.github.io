<!-- <h3 class="course-description">IDS 6267: Understanding Humans for Modeling and Simulation</h3> -->

Understanding Humans for Modeling and Simulation acted as my foundational course for the psychology side of modeling and simulation. I learned about different cognitive architectures and practiced applying these psychological concepts to create my own cognitive model. The model takes inspiration from existing models but instead depicts the cognitive process of a facilitator facilitating a team-building activity and determining when or if they should intervene in a situation.
