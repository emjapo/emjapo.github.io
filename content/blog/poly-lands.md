For my Virtual Reality Engineering class, I created a small adventure story set in the fictional Poly Lands to help connect the different demos. The story first implements wayfinding to guide the player to the market. Then the story utilizes interactions by providing the player with some weapons to chose from at the market place so that they will be able to defend themselves at night. The player is then led to a cabin to display physics in Unity before enemies attack the player. The last update sees the player teleporting to a safe location in the mountains to sleep for the night.
