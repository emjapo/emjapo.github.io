If you are interested in learning about neural networks, [TensorFlow Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/) is a great resource for helping build intuition about how they work. The interface is user friendly and allows for lots of customizations. I really can't recommend it enough especially if you are just starting to dip your toes into machine learning. Changing hyperparameters, datasets, network shapes, and activations and seeing how those impact performance in just a few seconds can do wonders for demystifying neural networks.

After playing around with the site for bit, I decided to do some comparisons between some different configurations. Changing all of the settings, running the models, and recording data is all well and good, but getting a bot to do all the dirty work is a lot better.
