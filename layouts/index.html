                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a Ph.D. student in the Modeling and Simulation program at the University of Central Florida. I
                    am an
                    alumni of Winthrop University with a degree in Digital Information Design with a concentration in
                    Web
                    Application Development and minors in Computer Science and Outdoor Leadership.</p>
                <p>My research interests lie in finding applications of AR/VR to address the sustainable development
                    goals
                    set forth by the UN. My dream project would be to find a way to use AR to help improve forestry
                    efforts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am simply on a goal to learn more about the world, myself, and everything in between. I have lots of interests, and I love talking about them. "Lore" is my word of the year, and I love learning new lore every chance I get.
