		<h2>Typography Site Design</h2>
		<p>
			For a visual communication class, we were challenged with designing a site around one
			font and having the content about the font. I choose the font Poppins. For the design, I
			used pop art elements and lots of circles to emulate the geometric design of the font.

		<h2>The Whisk It Shoppe</h2>
		<p>
			The capstone class of the Digital Information Design program combines all four
			disciplines to create a product for a real business. My group's project was to build a
			site and ordering system for a local bakery in Rock Hill, SC. As a web application
			design person, I was responsible for the backend of the site. I created a login flow,
			set up routing for the menu, made dynamic order forms, and built a cart system. The live
			site can be found at
			<a href="https://www.thewhiskitshoppe.com/">www.thewhiskitshoppe.com</a>.

		<h2>Object Site Design</h2>
		<p>
			For a visual communication class, we were challenged with designing a site around an
			object and targeting a demographic that would be interested in the object. I choose
			spoons and targeted children and parents of young children by making content that would
			make spoons appealing to them. For the design, I kept everything round and fun to make
			the site feel childlike, inviting, and playful.

		<h2>Game Site Redesign</h2>
		<p>
			For a visual communication class, we were challenged with redesigning a site for a video
			game. I choose Farming Simulator because I felt the existing site did not fully display
			the beauty of the game. For the design, I featured visuals from the game so that way
			they were the focus of the site. I also used earthy tones and metallic effects to
			reference the farm and the equipment which is such a large part of the game.
