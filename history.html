        <p>During the 1920s, Central European type foundries joined the modernists movements in art and design. <span class="green">Modernism was truly international</span> in scope; only three years after the founding of the German Bauhaus school, several of its painting instructors were already exhibiting their work in Calcutta.</p>
        <p><span class="blue">Geometric sans serif typefaces</span> have been a popular design element ever since these actors took to the world’s stage. Poppins is one of the newest comers to this long tradition. An open source family supporting both <span class="orange">Devanagari and Latin,</span> this typeface is an internationalist take on the geometric sans genre.</p>
        <p>Many of the Latin glyphs — the ampersand, for instance — are far more <span class="green">constructed and rationalist</span> than in previously released geometric typefaces.</p>
        <p>Poppins’s Devanagari design is particularly new. It is likely the <span class="blue">first-ever large Devanagari family</span> in this style that has been brought to market.</p>

        <h2><span class="large">“</span>Design studio Hugmun has created this super fresh identity for a juice bar in Poznań, Poland.</h2>
        <div class="text">
            <p>Juice Drinkers describes itself as "a place created by youthful and open-minded people". For ten years, it has been serving freshly squeezed juices at its popular spot. Hugmun was approached to refresh its brand. "Our focus was <span class="yellow">minimalism and simplicity</span> with a playful twist," says Joanna Ziemowska of the studio.</p>
            <p>One crucial element to consider was its new approach to materials. To protect the environment, Juice Drinkers has introduced returnable glass bottles and recyclable paper packaging. Joanna adds: 'We designed a packaging system, created a series of photos and introduced elements of the identity into their new venue. The summary of the entire identification is shown in the series of energetic photos reflecting the free, urban character of the brand.'</p>
            <p><span class="green">The classic Poppins font,</span> which appears in all communication materials, works together with a series of small, original, hand-drawn illustrations. <span class="orange">'The clean, structured,</span> black and white packaging system is the perfect setting for the joyful colourful juices,' Joanna says.<span class="large">”</span></p>
