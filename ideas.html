            hand.</p>

            <h1>Spoon Friend</h1>
            <p>You might’ve seen Forky from Toy Story 4 and thought, “I bet I can make something like that.” If you did think that, you
            were right. You can make your own toy friend with a spoon.</p>
            <p>The limit is your imagination on this one. You can make the spoons into little animals or little snowmen. You can make
            it into whatever you want.</p>

            <p>Metal spoons are great for reflecting light. You can make all kinds of pretty light art using some spoons.</p>
            <p>To get the best results, you will need a dark space, a flashlight, and of course some metal spoons!</p>
            <p>Shine the light into the spoons and see how it reflects onto the walls. You can play around by shining it onto different
            parts of the spoon or by arranging more than one spoon to make some pretty light art.</p>
